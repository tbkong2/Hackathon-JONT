# Hackathon-JONT
This is the code for our entry in one of the largest student run Hackathons in Alberta "HACKED", we have developed a GPT based discord bot that moderates a discord server using the Openai API key. We made it so that the discord bot either deletes or hides the discord messages that the GPT base would find as discrimination, hate speech, misinformation and much more. Our project won the AltaML challenge which was one of the various competitions within the whole Hackathons.
